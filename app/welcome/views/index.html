    <p>Think you know your child? The 100 questions in this app challenge parents to create "love maps" for their sons and daughters. In this app parents take turns trying to answer questions about their child. This is a fun exercise that can be replayed if parents donâ€™t know the answer to particular items, or deferred until after they talk to their child to find out the answers.</p>
